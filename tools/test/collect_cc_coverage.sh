# This script collects code coverage data for C++ sources, after the tests
# were executed.
#
# Bazel C++ code coverage collection support is poor and limited. There is
# an ongoing effort to improve this (tracking issue #1118).
#
# Bazel uses the lcov tool for gathering coverage data. There is also
# an experimental support for clang llvm coverage, which uses the .profraw
# data files to compute the coverage report.
#
# This script assumes the following environment variables are set:
# - COVERAGE_DIR            Directory containing metadata files needed for
#                           coverage collection (e.g. gcda files, profraw).
# - COVERAGE_MANIFEST       Location of the instrumented file manifest.
# - COVERAGE_GCOV_PATH      Location of gcov. This is set by the TestRunner.
# - COVERAGE_OUTPUT_FILE    Location of the final coverage report.
# - ROOT                    Location from where the code coverage collection
#                           was invoked.
#
# The script looks in $COVERAGE_DIR for the C++ metadata coverage files (either
# gcda or profraw) and uses either lcov or gcov to get the coverage data.
# The coverage data is placed in $COVERAGE_OUTPUT_FILE.

# Checks if clang llvm coverage should be used instead of $BAZEL_CC_CODE_COVERAGE.
